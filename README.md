# Shooting Game
# Created by Zijun Xia

## This is a shooting game made by java. The player can control the flight which can attack the enemy. When I learned the java, I want to combine the knowledge with the java game, so I made this game. The user can just firstly compile the java files, and then run the `.class` file to run this game. If the user can kill the enemy, he or she can get some score, and if the user was attack by the enemy and died, the game over, and the score will show out. 

## This shooting game used java for coding, there are several different java files for some different class. 

## The result should be that the player lose the game finally, and the longer game time presents the higher score that the player gets.
